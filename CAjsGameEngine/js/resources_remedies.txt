****** PROBLEMS *******
- when we first open the game, the enemies just fall out the canvas, so when run i need to refresh one time and then everything works 
- sounds, my sounds need to be somehow loop, for example fire bullet does not work for every click, only after sound if finished playing
- game is not really creative due to me focusing on trying to upgrade the whole engine with for example scenes and game manager
